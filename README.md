# End Portal Calculator Datapack

Find the exact Stronghold End Portal location using only two Eye of Ender throws — powered by real trigonometry!
And you thought you'd never need this outside of school… 😁

This datapack calculates the precise coordinates of the End Portal by analyzing the trajectory of two Eye of Ender throws, using angle-based triangulation. No guessing, no wasted time, no digging random tunnels — 100% accurate results.

## 📋 How to Use
